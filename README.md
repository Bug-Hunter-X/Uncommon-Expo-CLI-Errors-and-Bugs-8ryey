# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Bugs

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors and bugs encountered when using the Expo CLI.  These issues often stem from complex interactions between Expo modules, native dependencies, or third-party libraries, and are not readily addressed through typical troubleshooting.

Each example includes a problem description, the problematic code (`uncommonExpoBug.js`), and a potential solution (`uncommonExpoBugSolution.js`).  This repo aims to assist developers in identifying and resolving these less-common issues.

**Note:** These solutions may require a deep understanding of Expo's architecture and debugging techniques.
